Chilean Travel Destinations
===========================

Although Chile is not a huge country, it still holds many different geographic regions and cities. This
leads to many diverse places to visit in the wonderful country.


Atacama Desert
--------------

The Atacama Desert is one of the oldest and driest deserts on Earth. There are not many life forms
that can live here, however there are many unique geologic landforms. Since this desert is not heavily
populated and the climate does not allow for many clouds, it is a great place for telescopes and
night-sky viewing.

**Plaza de Armas**

The Plaza de Armas showcases the Spanish influences on Chile, as there are many plazas in Spain.
What makes Plaza de Armas unique is the many statues and monuments. The plaza is always busy with
people and is a great place to observe Chilean history and current culture at the same time.


**Cerro Santa Lucia**

The Cerro Santa Lucia is a city park in the very middle of Santiago. This hill has held many important
roles in the past, from being an ancient volcano to the site Santiago was claimed as capital of Chile.
Nowadays, the hill serves a much more gentle prospect and is a great place to relax and enjoy.
