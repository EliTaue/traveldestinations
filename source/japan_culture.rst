**Theatre:**

Noh theatre is an old form of Japanese storytelling. Noh involves slow movement dancing to rhythmic music to tell a story. Stories can be based on legend, history or modern events and usually involve the supernatural or dreams. Noh stages are very specific and include a bridge and a roof. [#f5]_

**Clothing:**

One of the most famous examples of Japanese clothing is the Kimono. A kimono is a t-shaped that is wrapped in a particular fashion. Kimonos are worn for special occasions in modern day but were the main clothing in Japanese history. Different patterns of fabric and colors have different significance and show importance. [#f6]_
