Las Fallas de Valencia
----------------------
Spain holds thousands of festivals and
celebrations each year, but one of the major
festivals that brings in people from around
the world each year is **Las Fallas**. The festival
is held in the city of Valencia from March 15-19,
but the excitement and preparation starts way
before then. [#f1]_

What is Las Fallas?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A festival that started as a celebration of
St. Joseph, patron saint of carpenters, turned
into a five day flaming extravaganza that
brings in millions of people.

For many people, the purpose of this festival
is for the parade and the eventual burning of
ninots, which are statues and figurines made
out of different materials like Styrofoam, wood,
papier- mâché and cardboard. [#f2]_

The Ninots
~~~~~~~~~~
The history of the creation of the ninot came
from the middle ages when carpentors would nail
planks of wood, called "parots", to hold their
candles up while they were working. In the spring,
the pieces of wood were burned to single the end
of the dark winter. After a while, the parots
were dressed up with clothing to identify a
local-personality. [#f3]_

The ninots, some with a cost of $100,000 dollars
to make and a year to make, are paraded around
the city and then set on fire under a big firework
display on March 19, La Crema as it is called.

One ninot is spared from burning by winning
the popular vote. This ninot, the ninot
indultat, is saved and stored in the local
Fallas Museum. `This`_ was the ninot indultat of 2019.

**"The scene at Las Fallas is extremely
cathartic and difficult to describe,
but resembles a cross between a bawdy
Disneyland, the Fourth of July, and the
end of the world,"** [#f5]_ traveler and self-described
pyromaniac Janet Morton told *Don Quijote*.

The burning of the fallas is not the only
event held at the festival, bullfights, paella
contests, beauty pagents and flower offerings draw
attention as well.

The festival is known to make a lot of noise and
commotion. It’s not for the feint of heart, and
pregnant women are not allowed to attend.
