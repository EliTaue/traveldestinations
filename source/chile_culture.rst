Culture
=======

The culture of Chile is similar to many others across South America, a mix of indigenous and Spanish cultures.
Presently, about 10% of population considers themselves fully indigenous, with the most prominent group
being the Mapuche. The Mapuche date back to 500-600 BC, and have stayed strong through conquests of the Incans
and more recently Spaniards.

Chile is religiously similar to the rest of South America with the majority (60%) believing in Roman Catholicism.
However, 25% are non-affiliated and 15% are Christian Protestant, both the highest precentages of any country
in South America.
