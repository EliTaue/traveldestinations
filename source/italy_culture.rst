Italian Culture
===============

Language
--------

The official language of Italy is officially Italian.
However, there is a larger percentage of the Italian
population that is able to communicate in english to
be able to talk to tourists and other travelers.

Traditional Clothing
--------------------

Italian's take their fashion very seriously. Typical
clothes with clean lines that fit you well are
standard, like button down shirts for men and capri
pants for women. Additionally, choose classy shoes
such as boots or ballet flats, since Italians
generally frown on wearing things like flip flops in
public.
