Spanish Food
============

    Spain has developed quite the profile when it
    comes to the quality and variety of food,
    and to only limit the list down would be a
    dishonor to the many dishes that can be found.
    Like many other countries, the regions within
    Spain are known to have their own different
    flavor profiles and dish origins because of
    weather and ethnicity variances. However, there
    are some that are considered to be a commonality
    of most Spanish cities, such as a plate of
    croquettes (a fried snack) or tortilla Espanola
    (a Spanish omelet).
